  Hey everyone, it's your boy strikermi9, also known as Benjamin Nunoo.<br>
  Welcome to my website, AstoFantasySec.com, or "AFS" for short.<br>
  This site is whatever you think it is a website, a brand, a group, or even a portfolio.<br>
  It's where I share the games I've created, showcase my projects (anything related to games),<br>
  and keep you updated on what I'm doing.<br><br>

  Creating this site was a mini project that I thought would be fun and interesting.<br>
  I've always wanted to create a proper site for myself, and you could say this site was inspired<br>
  by my first website, which had a similar intention.<br>
  I wanted a space where I could play games and access various content, which I have somewhat achieved.<br><br>

  Let me tell you a bit about myself.<br>
  I’m a 22-year-old university student at RAVEUNILDN, studying game programming to improve my skills<br>
  in Unreal Engine and Unity, as well as coding.<br>
  My goal is to become a game developer, focusing on game design and programming.<br>
  I would describe myself as hardworking, punctual, prepared, and eager to learn new things<br>
  that will benefit both me and others.<br><br>

  The work experience I've gained has taught me various coding languages, including HTML and CSS,<br>
  and provided me with the experience of making a game as part of a team.<br>
  I previously attended DigiLab (now known as Shapeways.io) for work experience,<br>
  and after that, I returned to improve my HTML and CSS skills.<br>
  I had the opportunity to work with others and even assisted as a coding teacher in a few sessions<br>
  to help teach youth club kids HTML and CSS.<br>
  I used to play youth soccer on two teams, AFC Wandsworth and Sporting Duet Academy,<br>
  and I was part of the school rugby team for a while back in secondary school.<br><br>

  Some of my interests include gaming, watching anime, and trading card games like Yu-Gi-Oh and Vanguard.<br>
  While I don't play sports as much these days, I used to be really into soccer,<br>
  and I'm currently getting into football (gridiron).
